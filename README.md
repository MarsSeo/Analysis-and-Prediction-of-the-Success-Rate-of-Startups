<h1>Introductuion</h1>
A startup is defined as a newly established company that lacks sufficient funding and resources. Startups face various uncertainties and have a high failure rate, with about 9 out of 10 businesses failing. Therefore, only a minority of startups succeed, and an even smaller fraction become unicorns. This research involves the use of two different startup datasets from the Kaggle website for distinct research purposes: The first dataset is used for exploratory data analysis to summarize the characteristics of successful startups, creating a profile of successful enterprises, thereby providing entrepreneurial advice for new business founders. With the second dataset, machine learning methods are employed to develop a binary classification model capable of predicting the success rate of startups. The model is further optimized and evaluated, providing investment guidance for investors.

<h1>Objectives</h1>

* This research conducts exploratory data analysis on a startup dataset, identifying key factors influencing startup success or failure to provide strategic advice for entrepreneurs. 
* Here, we employ machine learning techniques, comparing multiple models with untuned hyperparameters, then fine-tuning the top two models using cross-validation to mitigate overfitting, ultimately combining them into a Voting Classifier for reliable startup success predictions, guiding both entrepreneurs and investors.
