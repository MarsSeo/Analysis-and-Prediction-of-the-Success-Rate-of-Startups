<h1>Introductuion</h1>
This research explores two Kaggle startup datasets: the first for exploratory data analysis to identify traits of successful startups, offering insights for new entrepreneurs; the second for developing and optimizing a binary classification model using machine learning, aimed at predicting startup success rates, thus guiding investor decisions.

<h1>Objectives</h1>

* <b>Startup Success Analysis</b>: Perform exploratory data analysis on a startup dataset, pinpointing critical success and failure factors for strategic entrepreneurial guidance.

* <b>Machine Learning Model Development</b>: Compare various untuned models, then refine the top two using cross-validation to combat overfitting.

* <b>Predictive Success Modeling</b>: Merge the best models into a Voting Classifier, delivering robust startup success predictions for entrepreneurs and investors.
