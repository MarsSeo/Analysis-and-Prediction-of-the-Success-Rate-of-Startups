<h1>Introductuion</h1>
A startup is defined as a newly established company that lacks sufficient funding and resources. Startups face various uncertainties and have a high failure rate, with about 9 out of 10 businesses failing. Therefore, only a minority of startups succeed, and an even smaller fraction become unicorns. This research involves the use of two different startup datasets from the Kaggle website for distinct research purposes: The first dataset is used for exploratory data analysis to summarize the characteristics of successful startups, creating a profile of successful enterprises, thereby providing entrepreneurial advice for new business founders. With the second dataset, machine learning methods are employed to develop a binary classification model capable of predicting the success rate of startups. The model is further optimized and evaluated, providing investment guidance for investors.

<h1>Objectives</h1>

* <b>Startup Success Analysis</b>: Perform exploratory data analysis on a startup dataset, pinpointing critical success and failure factors for strategic entrepreneurial guidance.

* <b>Machine Learning Model Development</b>: Compare various untuned models, then refine the top two using cross-validation to combat overfitting.

* <b>Predictive Success Modeling</b>: Merge the best models into a Voting Classifier, delivering robust startup success predictions for entrepreneurs and investors.
